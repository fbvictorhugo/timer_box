## Scheme

![Scheme Fritzing](/res/timer_box_scheme_fritzing.png)

The scheme was carried out with the [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/)
 software. I tried to get as close as possible with the available components.

The schema file is also available here [scheme/timer_box.fzz](scheme/timer_box.fzz)
